Not a developer? Don’t worry, creating lessons and guides on how to start learning is one of the top priorities. In the meantime please feel free to poke around!

## Installation

1. Open the `source` directory of your site in terminal
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to watch files during development
4. Run `npm build` to bundle for production

## Development and Dependencies

Because there is no difference between server and client on the peer-to-peer web, everything is client-side. In practice, this feels like the conveniences of an API like Firebase’s, but native to the browser and data is saved locally to static files.

Enoki has some preferences in default tooling, but everything is swappable. The most notable is [Choo](https://choo.io), the cutest little front-end framework around. Think of it as React or Vue, but without the fluff. The main critisism of Choo is once you try it you wish everything else was like it :)

Instead of using Webpack, we opt for Browserify to bundle builds. Eventually you won’t need to bundle anything, but for now we find Browserify to be the most focused and calm. If you don’t feel, free to swap for whatever you’d like and use an Enoki Adapter to load the content object.

And of course, each design has it’s own Git repository, which you can use to pull in updates of the core design as they are made. Feel free to open issues and make pull requests, too!

## Resources

Because Enoki sites are real sites, the entire history of books, videos and tutorials as they relate to the internet at large are relevant in customizing your Enoki site.

### Choo

A great place to start is the [Choo](https://choo.io) homepage. There you’ll find a great overview of the core principles Choo represents. There is also the Choo handbook, which guides you through creating an app. The line between websites and apps is increasingly being blurred; play around with it.

### The peer-to-peer web

The community around Enoki has helped create the Peer-to-Peer Web event series. These are days dedicated to faciliating converations and workshops about peer-to-peer web, focusing on the importance of data ownership, archival, and accessibility.

Instead of focusing on this through the lens of technology, anyone doing anything involving creative thinking is invited to learn how the peer-to-peer web can be incorperated into their practice.

Documentation is available through the [web site](https://peer-to-peer-web.com) with more events planned for the future.
