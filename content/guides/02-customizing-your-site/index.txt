Not a developer? Don’t worry, creating lessons and guides on how to start learning is one of the top priorities. In the meantime please feel free to poke around!

## Installation

1. Open the `source` directory of your site in terminal
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to watch files during development
4. Run `npm build` to bundle for production

That’s it!

## Dependencies

Because there is no difference between server and client on the peer-to-peer web, everything is clientside.

## Dependencies

Enoki has some preferenaces in tooling, but everything is swappable. The most notable is [Choo](https://choo.io), a little front-end framework. Think of it as React or Vue, but without the fluff.
