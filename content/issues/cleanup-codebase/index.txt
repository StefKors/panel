text: Gotta refactor a little bit, itâ€™s getting messy in here.

- [ ] Switch from gr8 for layout to CSS grid/variables.
- [ ] Try to make the DOM as representational as possible.
- [ ] Simple `sheetify` css-in-js for most things.
- [ ] Support imports/require/window
- [ ] Create a bundle.js which exposes over window
- [ ] Create a super simple demo using no build system
