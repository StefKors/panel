text: ## Cleanup

Currently, fields are a bit sloppy. Some immediate improvements.

- [x] Store everything within an internal `state` object
- [X] Output a single object to `emit` containing `.value`

## New fields

- [X] Checkbox
- [ ] Range
- [ ] Radio selector
- [ ] Structured data
- [ ] Help (description sort of thing)
