# Enoki Starter Kit

## Structure

Enoki expects your project to contain directories, [**content**](#content) and [**site**](#site). If you’ve ever used [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/), this is very familiar.

- [Content](#content) contains all of your static files, like images and pdfs, and `.txt` files which contain your text and data.
- [Site](#site) contains your site’s source.

## Content

```

```

### Each directory is a page
