<h1 align="center">Enoki Panel</h1>

Documentation coming soon!

## Development

- Clone this repository
- Open Beaker Browser and create a new site
- Change the folder to the repository
- **`cd source`** open the source directory
- **`npm install`** install dependencies
- **`npm start`** watch for changes
- **`npm build`** bundle for production

You now have a fully standalone instance of the Enoki Panel free modify however you’d like. I’d suggest if you’d like to recieve updates to create a branch for your changes and merge them every once in a while.

## Fields

- For now, take a look at an example field such as `source/fields/text.js` to get a sense of structure.
- To register a field add it to `/source/fields/index.js`
- You can use a field in a blueprint by key name
